4. No High Risk Use; Acknowledgment and Waiver

4.1. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, you are not licensed to, and you agree not to, use, copy, sell, offer for sale, or distribute the Silta SDK, Aengin Devices, Aengin Software or Aengin Redistributables (whether compiled with, incorporated into, or packaged with your Application or otherwise), for or in connection with uses where failure or fault of the Aengin Device, Aengin Software, Aengin Redistributables or your Application could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage (“High Risk Use”). ANY SUCH USE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

4.2. You acknowledge the Silta SDK may allow you to develop Applications that enable the control of motorized or mechanical equipment, or other systems, machines or devices. If you elect to use the Silta SDK in such a way, you must take steps to design and test your Applications to ensure that your Applications do not present risks of personal injury or death, property damage, or other losses. The Aengin Device, the Aengin Software, the Aengin Redistributables and other software in the Silta SDK may not always function as intended. You must design your Applications so that any failure of a Aengin Device, the Aengin Software, a Aengin Redistributable and/or such other software does not cause personal injury or death, property damage, or other losses. If you choose to use the Silta SDK, (i) you assume all risk that use of the Aengin Device, the Aengin Software, the Aengin Redistributables and/or such other software by you or by any others causes any harm or loss, including to the end users of your Applications or to third parties, (ii) you hereby waive, on behalf of yourself and your Authorized Users, all claims against Aengin and its affiliates related to such use, harm or loss (including, but not limited to, any claim that a Aengin Device, the Aengin Software, a Aengin Redistributable or such other software is defective), and (iii) you agree to hold Aengin and its affiliates harmless from such claims.

5. Confidentiality and Privacy

8. Agreement and Development Program

We reserve the right to change this Agreement, the Silta SDK or the Aengin development and licensing program at any time in our discretion. Aengin may require that you either accept and agree to the new terms of this Agreement, or, if you do not agree to the new terms, cease or terminate your use of the Silta SDK. Your continued use of the Silta SDK after changes to this Agreement take effect will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to a change, you must stop using the Silta SDK and terminate this Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement by you under this Section 8 (and only this Section 8) will not affect your right, subject to your continued compliance with your obligations under this Agreement, to continue to distribute versions of your Application created and first distributed before termination, and will not affect the right of your End Users to continue using such versions of your Application, both of which rights will survive termination.
